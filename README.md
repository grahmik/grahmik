• 👋 Hi, I’m @grahmik AKA Mike Graham

• 👀 I’m compTIA Security+ certified and a graduate of the University of Kansas' cyber security program. I am deeply fascinated by coding/scripting, Linux and all things cyber security.

• I spend countless hours in my free time learning and improving. I am a member of Hack The Box, Pico CTF, and I run my own homelab.

• My current obsession is my homelab which I use to host my personal website and tinker with SIEMs and firewalls, as well as run some fun media servers for my family. 

• 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your team when you hire me! I have a willingness to learn and the drive to do it.
